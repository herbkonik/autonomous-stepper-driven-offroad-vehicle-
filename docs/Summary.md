# FOC-Powered Stepper Motor Robot Platform - Breaking the "Steppers Can't Drive" Myth

## Project Summary

A robust offroad-capable autonomous robot platform that proves stepper motors can be excellent vehicle drives when paired with Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This modular platform demonstrates 20° slope climbing capability on grass with a 10kg vehicle, while maintaining precise wall-following navigation using dual-core ESP32 processing.

Key Features:

Rocker-Differential-Suspension to tackle off-road terrain

Stepper motors integrated directly into the steering knuckle

Four-wheel drive and steering

FOC stepper motor control for high torque and smooth operation

Dual-core ESP32 architecture (sensor processing + navigation logic)

8x HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors with median filtering

PI controller for precise wall-following

Dynamic speed control based on obstacle proximity

Modular design: Motor control (MC1) + Navigation brain (MC2)

Open source platform for agricultural and offroad applications

Performance Highlights:

Climbs 20° slopes on grass (10kg vehicle weight)

Autonomous wall-following with angle and distance control

Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance

Sub-400ms sensor update cycle with dynamic sensor activation

Target Applications:

Agricultural robotics (lawn care, crop monitoring)

Offroad automation (cleaning, inspection)

Educational platform for robotics and control systems

Research platform for autonomous navigation

This project serves as proof-of-concept for a modular, open-source offroad robot chassis that can be adapted for various applications including robotic lawn mowers, agricultural assistants, and autonomous inspection vehicles.
