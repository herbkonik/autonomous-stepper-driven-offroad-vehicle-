# Rocker Differential Suspension (RDS)

## Mechanical Design and Operating Principle

### 1. System Overview

The Rocker Differential Suspension (RDS) is a passive, purely kinematic four-wheel suspension system designed for off-road mobility.  
It consists of two longitudinal rocker arms that are mechanically coupled to reduce chassis pitch while maintaining continuous ground contact on all wheels.

Unlike the  
**Rocker-Bogie Suspension**,  
the RDS does not use additional bogie links and operates with only four wheels.  
This results in a lighter, more compact, and mechanically simpler architecture while preserving excellent terrain adaptability.


# 2. Mechanical Design

## 2.1 Rocker Arms

The vehicle features:

- Two longitudinal rocker arms (left and right)

- Two rigidly mounted wheels per rocker (front and rear)

- One central pivot per rocker connected to the chassis

Each rocker forms a rigid two-wheel unit.  
When one wheel encounters an obstacle, the entire rocker rotates around its central pivot.

This motion allows:

- One wheel to move upward

- The opposite wheel of the same rocker to move downward

- Continuous ground contact on uneven terrain


## 2.2 Cable-Based Differential Coupling

Instead of a gear-based differential or torque shaft, the two rocker arms are coupled using **parallel, tensioned cables**.

### Cable Routing Concept

- Left front rocker section is connected to right front rocker section.

- Left rear rocker section is connected to right rear rocker section.

- The cables are routed along/over the vehicle body.

- The cables are kept under constant preload tension.

- The cables are **not crossed**.

### Functional Principle

When one rocker rotates upward:

- The corresponding cable increases tension.

- This tension transmits motion to the rocker on the opposite side.

- The opposite rocker responds proportionally.

Because front sections are linked to front sections and rear to rear, the system enforces a **symmetric angular relationship** between left and right sides.

This creates a mechanical averaging effect without gears.


## 2.3 Why a Cable Differential?

The cable-based solution provides several advantages:

### Mechanical Simplicity

- No gears

- No enclosed gearbox

- No lubrication required

### Reduced Weight

- Minimal rotating mass

- Very low structural overhead

### Off-Road Robustness

- Insensitive to dust and sand

- No risk of gear tooth damage

- Tolerant to shock loads

### Passive Shock Moderation

Although not a suspension in the classical sense,  
the slight elasticity of the tensioned cables can soften extreme impulse loads and reduce peak stress.


# 3. Kinematic Principle

The system approximates the following relationship:

Chassis pitch ≈ (Left rocker angle + Right rocker angle) / 2

If one rocker rotates upward due to an obstacle:

- The cable transfers part of that motion to the opposite rocker.

- The chassis adopts a moderated, averaged pitch angle.

- Extreme nose-up or nose-down attitudes are reduced.

This makes the RDS behave like a passive longitudinal stabilizer.


# 4. Terrain Interaction

### Single-Side Obstacle

1. Left front wheel climbs an obstacle.

2. Left rocker rotates upward.

3. The front cable increases tension.

4. Right rocker reacts proportionally.

5. Chassis pitch is reduced.

6. All four wheels maintain traction.


### Diagonal Articulation

When driving diagonally over uneven terrain:

- Both rockers rotate at different amplitudes.

- The cable system continuously balances angular differences.

- Load distribution remains nearly equal.

This improves:

- Traction

- Stability

- Energy efficiency

- IMU and sensor platform consistency


# 5. Advantages of the Cable-Coupled RDS

- Continuous four-wheel ground contact

- Reduced chassis pitch

- Mechanically simple and lightweight

- High robustness in harsh environments

- Well suited for autonomous off-road platforms


# 6. System Limitations

- No classical spring-damper suspension

- Not optimized for high speed

- Lower obstacle capability than six-wheel systems

The RDS is best described as a **low-speed, high-traction terrain system**.


# 7. Summary Description for the Project Page

> The Rocker Differential Suspension (RDS) is a four-wheel passive off-road suspension system using two rocker arms mechanically coupled via parallel, tensioned cables. The front sections are linked to front sections and the rear to rear, creating a symmetric mechanical averaging effect. This design reduces chassis pitch, maintains continuous ground contact, and maximizes robustness while keeping the mechanical complexity extremely low.
